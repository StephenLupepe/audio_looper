# audio_looper
A small app for playing audio and creating custom audio loops


This app will primarily use PySimpleGUI along with pydub to create a simple user interface that allows for the creation and replay of custom song loops.
This will involve:
  -Creating a simple media player interface that allows for song playback and contains basic media player functionality
  -Adding functionality that allows songs to be looped within a given start point and end point for a specified number of loops
  -Creating features that allow for easy manipulation of the current playback time and loop start point and end point (scope, sliders, etc.)
